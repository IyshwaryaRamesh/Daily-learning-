Daily Learning Documentation
Azure Function

Today, I learned what Azure Function is and understood why it is used in real-time projects. I got a clear idea of how it helps in running code without keeping the server always on. I also learned the steps involved in creating a function in Azure and how to connect it with VS Code.

Logic App

I learned what Logic App is and how it is used to automate workflows. I understood how to create a Logic App, how to trigger and schedule it, and how to initialize variables and execute queries inside it. I also got a clear understanding of how Logic App and Azure Function differ in their purpose and usage.

System Concepts

I learned about Deterministic and Probability Systems. From this, I understood how outcomes can be predictable in a deterministic system and how results can vary in a probability-based system. This helped me relate how such logic applies in real-world applications.

Company Competencies

I learned about the different competencies available in our company and how each area focuses on different technical and functional skills. This gave me a better understanding of where my role fits and what skills are important for future growth.

Today's Task

In today’s task, I solved three HackerRank programs based on if-else, arithmetic, and loops. These problems helped me revise my logic-building skills.
I also learned about data severities — how even a minute change in data can impact the system. This gave me a better sense of how confidential and sensitive data should be handled.
Additionally, I was assigned a task to find row count, column count, and compare random columns from the dataset. Through this, I got a practical understanding of data validation and analysis, and a clear idea of the kind of tasks we will be handling in the project.

Summary

Overall, today’s learning helped me understand Azure Functions and Logic Apps in depth, strengthened my coding skills through problem-solving, and made me realize the importance of data accuracy and confidentiality in real-time project work.
