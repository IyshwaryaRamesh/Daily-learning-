OpenAPI – Learned that it is used for designing and documenting APIs in a standardized format. It helps developers understand API endpoints, input/output, and responses without needing the actual code.

Internal API – Understood that these are used within an organization to connect internal systems (e.g., HR system interacting with payroll service).

Partner API – These are shared with external business partners in a controlled manner. For example, a travel booking platform connecting with airline APIs to fetch live flight information.

Composite API – Learned that this combines multiple service calls into one. For instance, in an e-commerce application, a composite API can fetch user details, cart items, and recommendations in a single request. It also helps in reducing server load.

REST API – Understood that REST APIs make functional calls over the Internet and follow HTTP protocol rules (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It’s widely used because it’s lightweight, flexible, and platform-independent.

SOAP API – Learned that SOAP uses XML for communication and is preferred in systems that need higher security and reliability, like banking or enterprise applications.

Deterministic vs Probabilistic Systems –

Deterministic systems: Produce the same output for the same input (e.g., a calculator).

Probabilistic systems: Outputs vary based on probability and uncertainty (e.g., weather prediction models).

Azure Functions – Explored how Azure Functions allow running small pieces of code in the cloud without managing infrastructure. They work on an event-driven model — functions execute only when triggered, saving cost and improving performance.

Summary:

Today, I deepened my understanding of different API types and their use cases, explored REST and SOAP communication models, and learned key system concepts like deterministic and probabilistic behaviors. I also gained insight into Azure Functions and how they simplify serverless execution in cloud environments.
