Introduction

Today, I explored and practiced working with the Azure Function App. My focus was to understand how it works, the setup process in the Azure portal, and how it can be deployed using Visual Studio Code.

Creating a Function App in Azure Portal

Opened the Azure Portal and navigated to the Function App service.

Selected the subscription and created a new resource group to organize the related resources.

Gave a Function App name and selected a runtime stack.

Chose an appropriate region and linked it to a storage account by giving a storage account name.

Configured the hosting and monitoring options as per the default setup.

Reviewed all configurations and successfully created the Function App.

Exploring Subscription Plans

Learned about the different subscription plans available for Function Apps in Azure.

Understood the difference between Consumption Plan, Premium Plan, and Dedicated (App Service) Plan.

Identified when to use each plan based on scalability, pricing, and performance needs.

Understanding Key Components

Explored what Resource Groups are and how they help in managing and organizing related Azure services.

Understood the purpose of a Storage Account, which stores the data, logs, and triggers used by the Function App.

Got familiar with the Function App settings, monitoring tools, and deployment options inside the portal.

Deployment Using Visual Studio Code

Installed the Azure Functions extension in Visual Studio Code.

Connected VS Code to my Azure account.

Created a new HTTP-triggered Function and customized the route.

Deployed the Function App from VS Code to Azure successfully.

Verified the deployment by testing the endpoint from the browser.

Creating and Testing Routes

Defined a custom route for the Function App to handle specific HTTP requests.

Tested the function route to confirm that it executed properly and returned the expected output.

Summary

Today, I learned how to create, configure, and deploy an Azure Function App both from the Azure Portal and through Visual Studio Code. I understood the importance of subscription plans, resource groups, and storage accounts in the setup process. Overall, this hands-on experience helped me get a better practical understanding of how serverless computing works in Azure and how Function Apps can be used to automate and host backend logic effectively.
